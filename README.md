# Udacity Data Wrangling Project - We Rate Dogs

A data gathering, assessing and cleaning project as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.\
\
This project involves data from a number of sources included an on hand CSV, a TSV pulled from the Udacity servers,\
and JSON data from the Twitter API (regrettably, Twitter wouldn't recognise my phone number as valid so I wasn't \
able to sign up for a dev account. Therefore the file was downloaded and read into a DF.
